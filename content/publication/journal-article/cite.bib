  abstract  = "AbstractChildren's participation in the social structure from
               the first stages of life shapes not only their development but
               also how they learn to become well‐adjusted members of their
               cultural environment. In the presented study, using focal‐follow
               and participatory observation, we depict the reality in early
               and middle childhood (N = 23; ages 2--7) of Yurakare children
               living in Bolivia's Amazonian area. We attempt to determine
               whether the facets of the LOPI model (Learning by Observing and
               Pitching in) proposed by Rogoff are represented in the everyday
               way of life of Yurakare children. This is the first systematic,
               quantitative study of children's social environment and practice
               in this Indigenous community. The results show that the
               practices of the Yurakare people are based on two things: (1)
               inclusion of all ages in community life, which cultivates
               children to engage in useful activities even while having fun;
               (2) the primacy of mature activities, which is in line with the
               LOPI model.",
