               also how they learn to become well‐adjusted members of their
               cultural environment. In the presented study, using focal‐follow
               and participatory observation, we depict the reality in early
               and middle childhood (N = 23; ages 2--7) of Yurakare children
               living in Bolivia's Amazonian area. We attempt to determine
               whether the facets of the LOPI model (Learning by Observing and
               Pitching in) proposed by Rogoff are represented in the everyday
               way of life of Yurakare children. This is the first systematic,
               quantitative study of children's social environment and practice
               in this Indigenous community. The results show that the
               practices of the Yurakare people are based on two things: (1)
               inclusion of all ages in community life, which cultivates
               children to engage in useful activities even while having fun;
               (2) the primacy of mature activities, which is in line with the
               LOPI model.",

  abstract  = "While various shortcomings and flaws in the conduct of research
               and analysis of results in psychology and other social sciences
               have been recognized for a long time, recent years have
               witnessed greater prevalence and wider scope of this criticism.
               There are also more proposals for improvement. In this article,
               we focus on selected, key areas of the credibility crisis in
               psychology. Piotr Wolski discusses those related to the improper
               understanding and application of significance tests, while
               Arkadiusz Bia{\l}ek characterizes some of the research practices
               that undermine the credibility of psychological studies and
               demonstrates how to counteract them. Although the use of good
               research practices can improve the reproducibility and
               replicability of research results, the proposed reform should
               also encompass the way theories are developed. The discussed
               proposal for theory development in psychology leads to a series
               of practical steps. Unlike the hypothetico-deductive model, it
               starts with the identification and description of the
               phenomenon. The explanation of the phenomenon formulated through
               abduction is then formalized in mathematical equations or
               computer simulations and verified. Adhering to good research
               practices and proper theory development has the potential to
               provide psychology with more solid foundations and make it a
               cumulatively evolving science.",

               lying behaviours of 2.5-year-olds, as measured by a modified
               temptation resistance paradigm (mTRP). Using a longitudinal
               design, 252 children's IC abilities were tested at ages 1.5, 2
               and 2.5, as well as their ability to lie at age 2.5. Results
               showed that 35\% of 2.5-year-olds peeked, 27\% of peekers lied
               and 40\% of non-peekers falsely confessed they had peeked.
               Non-peekers had higher IC than peekers at ages 2 and 2.5. Lower
               IC at age 2 increased the probability of peeking at age 2.5 by 6
               times. The highest level of IC was presented in children who
               followed the adult's restrictions in the mTRP and were then able
               to tell the truth about their behaviour. These results suggested
               that the first, or so-called primary, lies of 2.5-year-olds are
               probably spontaneous, rather than deliberate. Implications for

               remains controversial. This study proposed a developmental and
               social-constructionist perspective that challenges this notion
               through a model showing that coordination of perspectives (CoP)
               is a continuously developing ability in children. Our tested
               model comprises eight distinct abilities that emerge
               sequentially. We tested our model using 25 different tasks in a
               longitudinal six-wave study with 300 native Polish children aged
               from 1 year (MT1 = 1 year 0 months; SDT1 = 1.73 weeks; 44\%
               girls) to 3.5 years (MT6 = 3 years 6 months; SDT6 = 1.81 weeks;
               45\% girls). All children were Caucasian; both parents of 54\%
               children had university degree. Structural equation modeling
               with factor scores for each of the eight abilities was used to
               verify the fit of obtained data. We provide preliminary support
               for distinguishing six abilities: (a) immediate social
               perspective-tracking and taking at age of 1 year, (b) deferred
               social perspective-tracking and visual perspective-taking as an
               intermediate step at age of 2 years, and (c) epistemic
               perspective-tracking and taking at 3.5 years. Using our new
               nomenclature-emphasizing the function of coordination of own and
               another person perspective in social situations-we found that
               development of mindreading begins when infants coordinate their
               bodily-expressed orientations with those of others, and by the
               age of 4 is manifested by coordinating own and others mental
               states. Thus, we support the idea of heterotypic continuity of
               mindreading development. Development of CoP and difference
               between perspective-tracking and taking should be further
               elucidated. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights
